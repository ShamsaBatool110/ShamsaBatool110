### Hi there friendsðŸ‘‹
# About Me
I am a passionate **Computer Science** student eagerly interested in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**. In my journey so far, I have taken different courses and certifications and worked on some projects to get a hands-on practice on real world problems. The reason I am here is to connect with enthusiastic learners from whom I can learn and expand my knowledge and skill set.
