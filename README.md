# About Me
I started my career three years back as a passionate **Computer Science** student at **Namal University**. In my journey so far, I have taken different courses and certifications and worked on some projects to get a hands-on practice on real world problems. These courses and projects have contributed a lot in helping me find my areas of interest in Computer Science. I am eagerly interested in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.  The reason I am here is to connect with enthusiastic learners from whom I can learn and expand my knowledge and skill set.
 
# Projects
The projects I have done till now are **avaible on Github**. Everyone is free to view and suggest any modification, highlight any error and give feedback. I will welcome it open heartedly as I believe that, **a moment of error is a moment to learn**.
